# WPF Calculator and Binary-to-Decimal Converter

A simple yet powerful WPF application that combines a **calculator** and a **binary-to-decimal converter** into one easy-to-use interface. Built with C# and .NET, this app is perfect for anyone looking to perform basic calculations or quickly convert binary numbers to decimal.

## Features

### 1. **Calculator**
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Works with both **keyboard input** and **on-screen buttons**.
- Handles edge cases like division by zero with user-friendly error messages.

### 2. **Binary-to-Decimal Converter**
- Converts binary numbers (up to 8 digits) to their decimal equivalents.
- Simple and intuitive interface for quick conversions.

### 3. **User-Friendly Design**
- Clean and responsive WPF interface.
- Easy navigation between the calculator and converter.

## How It Works

The app is built using **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)** and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern for clean and maintainable code. The calculator logic handles both keyboard and button inputs seamlessly, while the converter ensures accurate binary-to-decimal conversions.
